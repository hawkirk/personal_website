Hello! My name is Harrison Kirk.

I'm interested in the intersection of data, technology, and public policy.

I currently work on the Health team at [Mathematica](https://www.mathematica.org/) as a Data Analytics Developer, based in Los Angeles.

My other interests include urbanism, minimalism, harm reduction, writing, filmmaking, music production, traveling, hiking, and hanging out with my dog, [Wren](https://www.instagram.com/wrenvworld).

Check out my [resume](/resume/) and [project portfolio](/projects/) for more on my skills and interests.
