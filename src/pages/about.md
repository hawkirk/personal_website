Hello! My name is Harrison Kirk.

I currently work on the Health team at [Mathematica](https://www.mathematica.org/) as a Data Analytics Developer, based in Los Angeles.

I'm interested in the intersection of data, technology, and public policy.

My other interests include urbanism, minimalism, harm reduction, writing, filmmaking, music production, traveling, hiking, and hanging out with my dog, [Wren](https://www.instagram.com/wrenvworld).
