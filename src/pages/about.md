Hello! My name is Harrison Kirk. I'm interested in the intersection of data, technology, and public policy. I currently work at [Mathematica](https://www.mathematica.org/) as a Software Engineer, based in Los Angeles.

This website is a living document--a place for me to share personal projects, writing, and professional updates. It's a little sparse now, but I hope to change that in the future!

Explore:
- [Projects](/projects/)
- [Writing](/posts/)
- [Resume](/resume/)

Outside of work, my other interests include urbanism, minimalism, harm reduction, filmmaking, music production, traveling, hiking, exploring LA, and hanging out with my dog, Wren.
